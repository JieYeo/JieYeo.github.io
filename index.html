Hello World

Some notes on mathematics

Reminders before we start:

The end goal for each topic is an elevator pitch

I would of course prefer to write only after fully understanding the subject, 
but after "fully understanding" the subject, I often feel there isn't much more to be said. 
Hence I shall start writing in even in the early stages of learning new topics.
I will inevitably sound stupid and mostly be copying things said by the old masters,
but this seems to have worked so far. If there is a better way, I would like to hear about it.

Priorities - geometry and topology research with James and Nathan. Then CS things.
Then the "practical topics" such as elementary combinatorics, probability, graph theory and such for 
financial mathematics. The foundations of analysis and probability come last, regrettably.

Understand one main example of GIT quotient : PGL(n) acting "canonically" on (P^n)^m
and compare this with how the quotient is taken in the symplectic (Marsden-Weinstein?) world

Understand how projective varieties work in general - basic things like why the coordinate ring has only constants and how we naturally generalise to sections of non-trivial line bundles.

Understand how (Cartier and Weil) divisors and line bundles work on toric varieties

Is every toric variety projective? How do we tell from the fan (or polytope) whether the toric variety is projective?

James said that choosing a line bundle on a toric algebraic variety corresponds to choosing a symplectic form on a toric symplectic manifold. How exactly?

What's great about Kaehler manifolds?
